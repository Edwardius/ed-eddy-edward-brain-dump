# **Cells of the Nervous System**
## **Consciousness and the Brain**
- **Materialism** – everything about the mind is reducible to physical brain activity.
- **Identity Position** – mental states _are identical to_ brain states.
- **Reductionism** – complex phenomena explained by simpler mechanisms.
- **Current View**: Monism (brain and mind are not separate).
- **David Chalmers**:
    - _Easy Problems_: Which brain activities produce which conscious states?
    - _Hard Problem_: Why does brain activity _create subjective experience at all_?
- **Panpsychism**: The idea that consciousness might be a fundamental property of all matter.
## **The Neuron Doctrine**
- Competing 19th-century views:
    - **Reticular Theory (Josef von Gerlach, Camillo Golgi)**: nervous system is a _continuous network_.
    - **Neuron Theory (Ramón y Cajal)**: nervous system is composed of _individual, autonomous cells_ (“contiguity, not continuity”).
- Cajal’s drawings confirmed neurons are distinct units — this is the **Neuron Doctrine**, foundation of neuroscience.
## **Types of Cells in the Brain**
- Whole brain: ~170 billion cells    
    - **Neurons**: ~86 billion (making up the **Grey Matter**)
    - **Glia**: ~84 billion (making up the **While Matter**)
- Ratios vary by region:
    - **Cerebral cortex**: ~16B neurons : 61B glia (~1:3.75)
    - **Cerebellum**: ~69B neurons : 16B glia (~4.3:1)
    - **Rest of brain**: ~0.7B neurons : 7.7B glia (~1:11)
## **The Neuron**
- **Main parts**: Soma (cell body), dendrites, axon, axon terminals.
- Function relates to shape:
    - **Multipolar neuron** – many dendrites, most common in CNS.
    - **Bipolar neuron** – one dendrite, one axon (e.g., retina).
    - **Unipolar neuron** – single process (e.g., sensory neurons).

**Inside the soma**: nucleus, ER, ribosomes, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, etc.
- Dendrites: receive input, covered in **spines** (plastic, motile, change shape in seconds).
- Axon: conducts signals, insulated by **myelin** with gaps called **Nodes of Ranvier**.
## **Axonal Transport**
- Microtubules serve as “tracks.”
- **Kinesin**: moves cargo _anterograde_ (from soma → axon terminal).
- **Dynein**: moves cargo _retrograde_ (axon terminal → soma).
- Ensures neurotransmitters, vesicles, and proteins reach where they’re needed.
## **The Synapse**
- Coined by **Charles Sherrington (1906)**: neurons are not continuous but communicate at junctions.
- **Presynaptic terminal** releases **neurotransmitters**.
- **Postsynaptic dendrite** receives them via **receptors**.
- This chemical communication allows flexibility and modulation of signals.

**Key distinction**
- **Efferent axons**: carry signals _away_ from a region.
- **Afferent axons**: carry signals _toward_ a region.
## **Glia**
Not just “support cells” — glia have crucial active roles.
### 1. **Astrocytes**
- Form part of the **blood-brain barrier** (BBB).
    - Tight junctions in capillaries restrict entry of molecules.
    - Only lipid-soluble substances (e.g., CO₂, fats) can diffuse freely.
    - Larger molecules (e.g., glucose, amino acids, insulin) need active transport.
- Regulate blood flow: dilate/constrict vessels.
- Provide nutrients to neurons.
- Connect with other astrocytes for molecule transfer.
- Create scaffolding that organizes neurons.
- **Tripartite synapse**: astrocytes wrap around synapses, modulate neurotransmission, and synchronize activity across multiple synapses.
