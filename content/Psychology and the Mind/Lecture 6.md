# **Drugs, Addiction, and Intro to Neuroanatomy**
## **Ketamine and Antidepressant Action**
- **Ketamine** acts on **glutamate neurotransmission**.
- Mechanism:
    1. Blocks **NMDA receptors** on **GABAergic interneurons** → reduces inhibition.
    2. Leads to **increased glutamate release** from excitatory neurons.
    3. Enhances **AMPA receptor activation** on glutamatergic neurons.
    4. Metabolized into **hydroxynorketamine (HNK)**, which also contributes to effects.
- Overall effect: disinhibition and enhanced glutamate signaling, linked to its **rapid antidepressant properties**.
## **Caffeine**
- Works through **adenosine receptors**:
    - Normally, **adenosine A1** receptors reduce excitatory release.
    - **A2A** receptors dampen dopamine receptor activity.
- **Caffeine blocks A1 and A2A receptors** → increases neurotransmitter release and dopamine activity.
- Also:
    - Releases Ca²⁺ from internal stores.
    - Interferes with GABA receptors (reduces inhibition).
- Result: **stimulant effect** (increased alertness, arousal).
## **Alcohol (Ethanol)**
- Complex, **non-selective pharmacological effects**:
    - Inhibits **voltage-gated Ca²⁺** channels (reduces release).
    - Affects **K⁺ channels**.
    - Binds to **ionotropic receptors** (ACh, serotonin, GABA, glutamate).
    - Enhances **adenosine signaling** (slows neural activity).
    - Interferes with **metabotropic receptors**, cell membranes, and even **gene expression**.
- General effect: **reduces neurotransmitter release** and inhibits postsynaptic activity.
## **Tolerance and Withdrawal**
- With repeated use, the brain **compensates** for drug effects (neural adaptation).
- **Tolerance**: same dose produces smaller effect.
- **Withdrawal**: opposite effect when drug is absent.
- Environmental cues can trigger anticipatory compensatory responses (classical conditioning).
## **Opioids (Morphine Example)**
- Bind to **μ (mu) opioid receptors**.
- Mechanism:
    - G-protein activation inhibits **Ca²⁺ channels** (less release) and opens **K⁺ channels** (hyperpolarization).
    - Over time: receptors become **desensitized** via phosphorylation and arrestin signaling.
- Strongly affect the **mesolimbic dopamine system**:
    - Dopaminergic neurons in the **ventral tegmental area (VTA)** project to the **nucleus accumbens**.
    - This circuit underlies **reward and addiction**.
## **Addiction and Reward Pathways**
- **Olds & Milner (1954)**: rats pressed levers thousands of times to self-stimulate the **septal area** → discovery of “pleasure centers.”
- This parallels modern dopamine reward circuitry:
    - VTA → nucleus accumbens pathway.
    - Strongly activated by drugs, but also exploited by modern tech (e.g., Facebook’s “dopamine hit” model for likes).
- Addiction = hijacking of natural reward systems → compulsive behavior despite consequences.
## **Brain Changes in Addiction**
- **Cocaine users** show reduced glucose metabolism in the **prefrontal cortex**.
- Indicates impaired executive function, decision-making, and impulse control.
- Addiction is not just chemical but also **structural and functional brain change**.
## **Intro to Neuroanatomy**
- **Planes of Section**:
    - **Sagittal**: divides left/right.
    - **Coronal**: divides front/back.
    - **Horizontal (axial)**: divides top/bottom.
- **Directional Terms**:
    - **Rostral (anterior)** = toward front.
    - **Caudal (posterior)** = toward back.
    - **Dorsal (superior)** = upward. (unless looking at spine, then dorsal is pointing out of your back)
    - **Ventral (inferior)** = downward.
    - **Medial** = toward midline; **lateral** = away from midline.
- **Ipsilateral**: same side.
- **Contralateral**: opposite side.
## **Spinal Cord Anatomy**
- **CNS** = brain + spinal cord.
- **PNS** = spinal nerves + cranial nerves.
- Spinal cord ends around **L1 vertebra**.
- Nerves extend downward as the **cauda equina**.
### **Spinal Nerve Organization**
- **Cervical (C1–C8)**
- **Thoracic (T1–T12)**
- **Lumbar (L1–L5)**
- **Sacral (S1–S5)**
- **Coccygeal (Co1–Co3)**
