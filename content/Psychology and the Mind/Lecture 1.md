## **What is Physiological Psychology?**
Physiological psychology studies the biological bases of behavior, cognition, and consciousness. It links **mind, body, and brain**.

Think of it as the intersection between **psychology** and **biology**, answering: _How does the brain produce behavior and mental states?_
## **Early Theories About the Mind and Body**
### 1. Encephalocentric Theory – _Hippocrates (460–379 BCE)_
- The **brain is the organ of the mind**.
- Epilepsy originates in the brain.
- First ideas of **lateralization** (different sides of the brain serving different functions).
### 2. Cardiocentric Theory – _Aristotle (384–322 BCE)_
- Believed **thoughts come from the heart**.
- The brain’s role was just to **cool the blood** and regulate the heart.
- A huge historical debate: _brain vs. heart as the center of thought_.
## **Dualism vs. Monism**
### Dualism
- **Plato (~428–348 BCE)**: The body and soul are separate.
    - Body: visible, changeable, mortal.
    - Soul: invisible, unchanging, immortal.
### Monism
- **Epicurus (341–270 BCE)**: The soul is _material_.
    - It’s made of “fine particles.”
    - Rejects immortality of the soul.
    - Leads toward **materialism** (mind = matter).
        
This sets the stage for a key debate:
- **Is the mind something immaterial (dualism)?**
- **Or is it simply a function of the brain/body (monism)?**

## **Rene Descartes (1596–1650 CE)**
- Famous for **mind-body dualism** (“Cartesian Dualism”).
- Human body = a machine, operates by **reflexes**.
- The **mind is immaterial** but interacts with the body via the **pineal gland**.
- Introduced the idea that experiments could test these hypotheses.

This shaped how early science approached the brain.
## **Phrenology and Localization**
- **Franz-Joseph Gall (1758–1822 CE)**:
    - Proposed **phrenology** – cranioscopy (skull bumps reflect mental faculties).
    - Wrong, but important: it introduced **localization of function** (different brain regions = different functions).
- **Paul Broca (1824–1880 CE)**:
    - Studied patient “Tan” who had speech loss.
    - Discovered **Broca’s Area**: region for **speech production** in the left frontal lobe.
    - A major scientific confirmation of **localization**.
        
## **Language and the Brain**

- Brain regions for language:
    - **Broca’s Area** – speech production.
    - **Wernicke’s Area** – language comprehension.
    - **Angular Gyrus** – reading/writing integration.
    - **Auditory Cortex** – hearing words.
    - **Motor Cortex** – controlling lips, mouth, etc.

Language shows **hemispheric specialization** (mostly left hemisphere).
## **Disorders of Perception**
### Neglect (Spatial/Hemispatial Neglect)
- Caused by damage to **right parietal and temporal lobes**.
- Patient ignores one side of space/body (often the left).
- Examples: copying drawings only on one side, ignoring food on one side of a plate.
- Shows how brain lesions affect conscious experience.
## **Split Brain Studies**
- **Commissurotomy**: cutting the **corpus callosum** (connection between hemispheres).
- Early patients (1940s–1960s) seemed normal in daily life.
- But experiments revealed:
    - **Alien hand syndrome** (one hand acts independently).
    - Split visual fields – what the left visual field sees cannot be verbalized (because right hemisphere has no speech centers).
- These studies demonstrated **hemispheric specialization** and **lateralization of function**.
