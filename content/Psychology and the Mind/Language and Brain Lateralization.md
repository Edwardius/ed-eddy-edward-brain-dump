## **Language and the Brain**
![[Pasted image 20251002150610.png]]
- Brain regions for language:
    - **Broca's Area** – speech production.
    - **Wernicke's Area** – language comprehension.
    - **Angular Gyrus** – reading/writing integration.
    - **Auditory Cortex** – hearing words.
    - **Motor Cortex** – controlling lips, mouth, etc.

Language shows **hemispheric specialization** (mostly left hemisphere).
## **Disorders of Perception**
### Neglect (Spatial/Hemispatial Neglect)
- Caused by damage to **right parietal and temporal lobes**.
- Patient ignores one side of space/body (often the left).
- Examples: copying drawings only on one side, ignoring food on one side of a plate.
- Shows how brain lesions affect conscious experience.
## **Split Brain Studies**
- **Commissurotomy**: cutting the **corpus callosum** (connection between hemispheres).
- Early patients (1940s–1960s) seemed normal in daily life.
- But experiments revealed:
    - **Alien hand syndrome** (one hand acts independently).
    - Split visual fields – what the left visual field sees cannot be verbalized (because right hemisphere has no speech centers).
- These studies demonstrated **hemispheric specialization** and **lateralization of function**.

## **Corpus Callosum**
- Connects left and right hemispheres.
- Allows interhemispheric communication.
- Damage/disconnection → classic split-brain phenomena.
