## **What is Physiological Psychology?**
Physiological psychology studies the biological bases of behavior, cognition, and consciousness. It links **mind, body, and brain**.

Think of it as the intersection between **psychology** and **biology**, answering: _How does the brain produce behavior and mental states?_
## **Early Theories About the Mind and Body**
### 1. Encephalocentric Theory – _Hippocrates (460–379 BCE)_
- The **brain is the organ of the mind**.
- Epilepsy originates in the brain.
- First ideas of **lateralization** (different sides of the brain serving different functions).
### 2. Cardiocentric Theory – _Aristotle (384–322 BCE)_
- Believed **thoughts come from the heart**.
- The brain's role was just to **cool the blood** and regulate the heart.
- A huge historical debate: _brain vs. heart as the center of thought_.
## **Dualism vs. Monism**
### Dualism
- **Plato (~428–348 BCE)**: The body and soul are separate.
    - Body: visible, changeable, mortal.
    - Soul: invisible, unchanging, immortal.
### Monism
- **Epicurus (341–270 BCE)**: The soul is _material_.
    - It's made of "fine particles."
    - Rejects immortality of the soul.
    - Leads toward **materialism** (mind = matter).
        
This sets the stage for a key debate:
- **Is the mind something immaterial (dualism)?**
- **Or is it simply a function of the brain/body (monism)?**

## **Rene Descartes (1596–1650 CE)**
- Famous for **mind-body dualism** ("Cartesian Dualism").
- Human body = a machine, operates by **reflexes**.
- The **mind is immaterial** but interacts with the body via the **pineal gland**.
- Introduced the idea that experiments could test these hypotheses.

This shaped how early science approached the brain.
## **Phrenology and Localization**
- **Franz-Joseph Gall (1758–1822 CE)**:
    - Proposed **phrenology** – cranioscopy (skull bumps reflect mental faculties).
    - Wrong, but important: it introduced **localization of function** (different brain regions = different functions).
    - This principle proven correct - see [[Forebrain and Cortical Structure#Cortical Maps|cortical maps]] and [[Language and Brain Lateralization#Language and the Brain|language areas]]
- **Paul Broca (1824–1880 CE)**:
    - Studied patient "Tan" who had speech loss.
    - Discovered [[Language and Brain Lateralization#Language and the Brain|Broca's Area]]: region for **speech production** in the left frontal lobe.
    - A major scientific confirmation of **localization**.

## **Consciousness and the Brain**
- **Materialism** – everything about the mind is reducible to physical brain activity.
- **Identity Position** – mental states _are identical to_ brain states.
- **Reductionism** – complex phenomena explained by simpler mechanisms.
- **Current View**: Monism (brain and mind are not separate).
- **David Chalmers**:
    - _Easy Problems_: Which brain activities produce which conscious states?
    - _Hard Problem_: Why does brain activity _create subjective experience at all_?
- **Panpsychism**: The idea that consciousness might be a fundamental property of all matter.
