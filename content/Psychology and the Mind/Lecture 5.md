# **Synaptic Types, Transmission, and Drugs**
## **The Tripartite Synapse**
- Classical view: communication is between **presynaptic axon terminal** and **postsynaptic dendritic spine**.
- Updated view: **astrocytes** also play an active role.
    - They take up neurotransmitters, release **gliotransmitters**, and help regulate ionic balance (K⁺, Ca²⁺).
    - This creates a _tripartite_ synapse: neuron–neuron–astrocyte.
- Important note: **glutamate**, though the main excitatory neurotransmitter, can be toxic in excess → leads to **excitotoxicity** and neuronal death.
## **Types of Synapses**
- Classified by the location of contact:
    - **Axodendritic**: axon → dendrite.
    - **Axo-somatic**: axon → soma.
    - **Axo-axonic**: axon → axon (often modulatory).
## **The War of the Soups and Sparks**
- Early 20th century debate:
    - **“Sparks” (neurophysiologists)** – believed transmission was **electrical**, based on direct measurements of neuron activity.
    - **“Soups” (pharmacologists)** – believed it was **chemical**, supported by effects of drugs and toxins (e.g., curare blocking ACh).
- Resolution: both were partly correct.
    - Most synapses are **chemical**, but **electrical synapses** exist too.
- Nobel Prizes:
    - Henry Dale & Otto Loewi (1936) → discovery of chemical neurotransmission.
    - John Eccles (1963) → synaptic physiology.
## **Electrical vs. Chemical Synapses**
### **Electrical Synapses (Gap Junctions)**
- Direct physical connections between cells via **connexons**.
- Allow passage of ions and small molecules directly between cytoplasms.
- Very fast, synchronous communication.
- Found widely across brain regions, often in interneurons.
### **Chemical Synapses**
- Neurotransmitters cross a cleft and bind to receptors.
- Slower but more flexible and modifiable.
### **Mixed Synapses**
- Some synapses combine both electrical and chemical transmission.
- Example: hippocampus synapses with **connexin-36** gap junctions coupled with glutamatergic transmission.
## **Neuropeptides**
- Examples: Enkephalins, Substance P, Oxytocin, Insulin.
- Key features:
    - Synthesized in the soma (not terminal).
    - Often released from dendrites, soma, or axon sides—not just terminals.
    - Long half-life (~20 minutes; contrast with ms for classical transmitters).
    - Spread to distant targets.
    - Functions: modify synapses, alter gene expression, regulate glia.
## **Gaseous Neurotransmitters**
- **Nitric oxide (NO)** is a key example.
- Small, membrane-permeable → diffuses freely across membranes.
- Can act retrogradely (postsynaptic → presynaptic).
- Regulates synaptic strength, vascular tone, and plasticity.
## **Co-Transmission**
- A single neuron can release multiple types of neurotransmitters.
- Example: one cell might release both a small-molecule transmitter (e.g., glutamate) and a peptide (e.g., substance P).
## **Drugs and Toxins at the Synapse**
### **Preventing Action Potentials**
- **Local anesthetics (Novocain)** and **tetrodotoxin (pufferfish)** block **Na⁺ channels**.
- Without sodium influx, no action potential can propagate.
### **Preventing Neurotransmitter Release**
- **Spider venoms** (e.g., funnel-web spider) block **Ca²⁺ channels** → no vesicle fusion.
- **Botulinum toxin (BoNT, Botox)** interferes with **SNARE proteins** → blocks exocytosis, reduces neurotransmitter release.    
### **Increasing Neurotransmitter Release**
- **Black widow spider venom** (latrotoxin):
    - Creates pores for Ca²⁺ influx and neurotransmitter leakage.
    - Massive ACh release → muscle spasms.
- **Amphetamines & methamphetamine**:
    - Reverse transporters (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin).
    - Increase vesicular release.
    - Block uptake into vesicles.
    - Net effect: **more neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft**.
    - **Adderall** produces prolonged dopamine release compared to isomers.
### **Preventing Reuptake**
- **Cocaine, Ritalin, antidepressants**: block transporters for dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin.
- Leads to **increased levels in the synaptic cleft**.
### **Preventing Deactivation**
- **Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)**: block MAO enzyme, preventing breakdown of monoamines.
- **Organophosphates (pesticides)**: block acetylcholinesterase → ACh accumulates, causing overstimulation.
### **Blocking Receptors**
- Some **antipsychotics** block serotonin receptors (e.g., clozapine).
- **Black mamba venom** blocks muscarinic ACh receptors → paralysis.
### **Stimulating Receptors**
- **LSD** → binds serotonin receptors.
- **Nicotine** → binds nicotinic ACh receptors.
- **Opiates (morphine, heroin)** → bind endorphin receptors.
### **Mimicking Retrograde Transmitters**
- **THC (marijuana)** mimics **endocannabinoids** (anandamide, 2-AG).
- Binds presynaptic **cannabinoid receptors** → inhibits Ca²⁺ channels, reducing neurotransmitter release.
- Chronic cannabis use can cause long-term cognitive impairments (attention, memory, information processing).
